# Bash Scripts

Because data is meant to be organized

## Description

These are some Bash scripts I wrote last year. Good for scraping data from registrars using whois. I've written a number of scrapers over the years. Getting good data is challenging, and requires a time element. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* Bash
* Terminal

### Executing program

* Download it, navigate to the directory and run it like this 

```
./whois5.sh
```
