# Python Hacking

This is a collection of project scripts and logic puzzles that are solved in Python. And there are some AWS DeepRacer reward scripts.

## Description

Most of this code is my solutions to CTFs. I like to compare my code to AI code and evaluate modern AI code solutions. It's a training location, where I can store solutions to all sorts of coding puzzles.

Some of this code is for the cybersecurity pros and hackerz. You know who you are and you want the scrapers or the proxies.
